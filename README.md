# Append-pixel-dimensions
Applescript droplet.  Adds the pixel dimensions of image files at the end of the file name.

#### Notes
Drag and drop multiple image files on the droplet.  Reads the files' pixel dimensions. Overwrites original file names.
<br/> Useful if you have multiple iterations of an image file for different output (e.g. mobile vs. desktop), or are working with team members who aren't familiar with image editing software.
